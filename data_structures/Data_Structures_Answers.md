For each of the methods associated with each data structure, classify it based on its runtime, using Big O notation.

## Linked List

1.  What is the runtime complexity of `addToTail`?
    O(1)
    a. What if our list implementation didn't have a reference to the tail of the list in its constructor? What would be the runtime of the `addToTail` method?
    O(1) still since you could easily check for the array's last element.

2.  What is the runtime complexity of `removeHead`?
    O(1)

3.  What is the runtime complexity of `contains`?
    O(n)

4.  What is the runtime complexity of `getMax`?
    O(n)

## Queue

1.  What is the runtime complexity of `enqueue`?
    O(1)

2.  What is the runtime complexity of `dequeue`?
    O(1)

3.  What is the runtime complexity of `isEmpty`?
    O(1)

4.  What is the runtime complexity of `length`?
    O(1)

## Doubly Linked List

1.  What is the runtime complexity of `ListNode.insertAfter`?
    O(1)
2.  What is the runtime complexity of `ListNode.insertBefore`?
    O(1)
3.  What is the runtime complexity of `ListNode.delete`?
    O(1)
4.  What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.addToHead`?
    O(1)
5.  What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.removeFromHead`?
    O(1)
6.  What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.addToTail`?
    O(1)
7.  What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.removeFromTail`?
    O(1)
8.  What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.moveToFront`?
    O(1)
9.  What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.moveToBack`?
    O(1)
10. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.delete`?
    O(1)
    a. Compare the runtime of the doubly linked list's `delete` method with the worst-case runtime of the `Array.splice` method. Which method generally performs better?
    worst case for splice would be O(n) since there is shifting of the whole array. DLL's delete would be O(1) since there are no indexes to deal with.

## Binary Search Tree

1.  What is the runtime complexity of `insert`?
    O(n)
2.  What is the runtime complexity of `contains`?
    O(n)
3.  What is the runtime complexity of `getMax`?
    O(log n)
4.  What is the runtime complexity of `depthFirstForEach`?
    O(n)
5.  What is the runtime complexity of `breadthFirstForEach`?
    O(n)
6.  [Stretch Question] What is the runtime complexity of your `checkBalanced` function?

## Heap

1.  What is the runtime complexity of your `heapsort` function?
    O(n)
2.  What is the space complexity of the `heapsort` function? Recall that your implementation should return a new array with the sorted data. What would be the space complexity if your function instead altered the input array?
    O(n)
3.  What is the runtime complexity of `bubbleUp`?
    O(log n)
4.  What is the runtime complexity of `siftDown`?
    O(n)
5.  What is the runtime complexity of `insert`?
    O(n log n)
6.  What is the runtime complexity of `delete`?
    O(n)
7.  What is the runtime complexity of `getMax`?
    O(1)
